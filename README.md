# Stellated_Octahedron

#modified_tutorial03.cpp has a function draw_triangle() that takes as arguments a different model matrix and (r, g, b) color for each isosceles triangle to be drawn. There are also functions for drawing a right triangle, square, and cube.

#Create a new 3-D polyhedron from multiple transformed versions of the isosceles triangle, right triangle, and/or square.

#3-D polyhedron must have at least 20 sides
#Your calls to draw the polyhedron that you created cannot be "hard-coded" to make pattern varying the color and scale/orientation/location of the objects.

#Your pattern must have â‰¥ 100 copies of your 3-D shape
